set of scripts and configs for testing ipsec...

mk.sh will take all the .conf files, and create a (master) and b (slave)
to drive the tests...  To create the files, it prepends common.ab, and
appends either sp.ah.[ab] or sp.esp.[ab] depending upon if the conf
file starts w/ either ah or esp...

Some base config files can be created using the mkah.sh and mkesp.sh
scripts... They use ah.txt and esp.txt to create config files...

The scripts master.sh and slave.sh will drive the tests, simply start
slave.sh on one machine, and then run master.sh on another, and away
things go...
